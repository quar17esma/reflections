How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    We can see all changes made in the file, so we can find where we made mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can use history to see all changes, to find mistakes and to come back to previuos versions with no mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing allows us to choose perfect time and size for commit, but we also become responsible for this.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Becouse developers need to track changes in files connected with each athor, and Google Docs is just a tool to store separate docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    We can track all changes in files and difference between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    With VCS I can allways comeback to previous version of my project.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I need Git as Developoer Tool
